# Angular Material Quickstart

This project aims to speed you up while getting started with Angular Material. 

In addition to standard Angular CLI 6 + Angular Material project setup, following modifications were made:

 - scss used as default style extension instead of css
 - navigation panel installed
 - some minor css setup 
 
 ## Running Docker Instance
 
 Run the following command. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
 ```
 docker-compose up -d --build
 ```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Improving this project

Dockerizing the project would be a nice step forward.
